                <p>The main goal of Roof-a-woof was
                    to rescue dogs from the horrifying
                    conditions of laboratory life, where they
                    are used for biomedical research, product
                    testing, and other activities.

                <h3>AliExpress Redesign</h3>
                <p>The original website has a very heavy
                    weight color scheme, i.e Red, which
                    distracts the user from the actual
                    content, so it has been changed to very
                    balanced tone which has good contrast.<br> <b>Date:</b> March 23,2023</p>
